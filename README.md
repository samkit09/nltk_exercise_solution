Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a process of manipulating or understanding the text or speech by any software or machine. An analogy is that humans interact and understand each otherâ€™s views and respond with the appropriate answer. In NLP, this interaction, understanding, and response are made by a computer instead of a human.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite that contains libraries and programs for statistical language processing. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.
